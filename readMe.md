# DATA's chain of thought to build this Skill

Please make a DATA Skill that can solve any problem that can be represented in this interface by reasoning through it now.

# Here is the documentation of what DATA made, and how it thought about the problem to arrive at the solution.

DATA's Initial Written Specification
Let's build a DATA skill called ARC Solver üß©. To use this skill, you should provide the file path or URL to a single ARC task JSON file in the following format:

<userRequest> Please solve the ARC task in the file [insert path or URL to task JSON file] </userRequest>

# The ARC Solver skill will then:

üì• Load the specified task JSON file and parse the train/test pairs
üîç Analyze the train pairs to identify transformation patterns and rules
üß™ Iteratively test and refine the hypothesized rules against all train pairs
‚úÖ Apply the learned rules to solve each test pair
üìù Format the step-by-step solution and explanations in a markdown document
üì® Return the formatted solution and send an SMS alert that it's ready
The skill aims to flexibly handle any ARC task that can be represented in the standard grid-based JSON format. It will intelligently reason through the task using AI-assisted rule induction and refinement techniques.

## To build this, we'd follow these key steps:

Set up the core skill structure with the standard DATA skill inputs/outputs
Implement functions to load task JSON from file path or URL and parse train/test pairs
Develop prompts for AI to analyze train pairs and hypothesize transformation rules
Create a rule testing and refinement loop leveraging gptRequest and markdown outputs
Apply final rules to solve test pairs, with additional refinement if needed
Format the full solution explanation in markdown, including input/output grids
Return the solution doc, send SMS alert, and thoroughly log each reasoning step
The skill would be published with a detailed description, reliability metrics, usage examples, and clear limitations. Users could then easily invoke it on any ARC task to generate an explainable solution attempt.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm excited to flesh out the full implementation of this skill.

# DATA üß©üí°
## DATA's Q&A Planning
Here are some questions and clarifications needed to ensure the ARC Solver skill fits into the constraints of a DATA Skill Next.js API route:

How will the user provide the file path or URL to the task JSON file within the userRequest? Should there be a specific format or syntax for specifying this?

For loading the task JSON file, will the skill need to handle both local file paths and remote URLs? Are there any security considerations to keep in mind when loading files?

What specific AI models and techniques will be used for analyzing the train pairs and hypothesizing transformation rules? Will this be done using a series of gptRequests or a different approach?

How will the transformation rules be represented and stored internally during the rule refinement loop? Will they be kept as strings, objects, or a custom data structure?

What format should be used for the step-by-step solution explanations in the markdown document? Is there a specific template or structure to follow?

How will the input/output grids be represented within the markdown solution document? As tables, images, or a different format?

Will the skill need to handle edge cases such as invalid file paths, malformed JSON, or tasks that don't fit the expected format? How should it gracefully handle these situations?

Are there any performance considerations to keep in mind, especially for larger or more complex tasks? Should there be any limits or timeouts enforced?

For sending the SMS alert, what specific function or API will be used? Are there any additional parameters or configurations needed?

How detailed should the logging be at each step of the process? What specific information should be included in the debug output?

Are there any additional error handling or validation steps needed to ensure the skill executes smoothly and provides meaningful feedback to the user?

Should there be any specific formatting or structure for the final API response, such as separating the solution document from the debug information?

Addressing these questions and clarifying the relevant details will help ensure the ARC Solver skill can be fully implemented as a self-contained DATA Skill within a single Next.js API route.

Here are the answers and solutions to address each question and ensure the ARC Solver skill fits into the constraints of a DATA Skill Next.js API route:

The user will provide the file path or URL to the task JSON file within the userRequest as a single line in the format: path/to/file.json or https://example.com/task.json. The skill will parse the userRequest to extract the file path or URL.

The skill will handle both local file paths and remote URLs for loading the task JSON file. For security, the skill will validate the file path or URL and ensure it points to a valid JSON file before attempting to load it. If the file is not accessible or invalid, the skill will return an appropriate error message.

The skill will use a series of gptRequests to analyze the train pairs and hypothesize transformation rules. The prompts will be designed to guide the AI model in identifying patterns, proposing rules, and refining them based on the train pairs. The prompts will be stored as objects or constants for clarity and reusability.

The transformation rules will be represented as strings during the rule refinement loop. Each rule will be a human-readable description of the transformation pattern. The skill will maintain an array of rule strings, which will be refined and updated as the AI model analyzes more train pairs.

The step-by-step solution explanations in the markdown document will follow a structured template. Each step will be represented as a markdown heading, followed by a description of the transformation rule applied and the resulting output grid. The skill will generate the explanations dynamically based on the refined rules and test pair results.

The input/output grids will be represented as markdown tables within the solution document. Each cell will be a markdown table cell, with the corresponding symbol or color. The skill will convert the grid data structures to markdown tables for inclusion in the document.

The skill will include error handling for edge cases such as invalid file paths, malformed JSON, or unsupported task formats. It will use try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to the user. If an error occurs, the skill will return a descriptive error message in the API response.

To address performance considerations, the skill will implement timeouts for loading the task JSON file and set a maximum limit on the number of train pairs and test pairs it can process. If the task exceeds these limits, the skill will return an appropriate message indicating the limitation.

For sending the SMS alert, the skill will use the sendCallback function with the generated markdown solution document as the content argument. The function will handle the actual sending of the SMS.

The logging will include key information at each step of the process, such as the loaded task JSON, the extracted train and test pairs, the hypothesized rules at each iteration, and the final solution document. The debug output will be appended to the debug variable as markdown-formatted text for easy readability.

The skill will include validation steps to ensure the loaded task JSON adheres to the expected format and structure. It will also validate the generated solution document to ensure it is well-formed markdown before sending it as the API response.

The final API response will be a JSON object with separate properties for the solution document (message) and the debug information (debug). The message property will contain the markdown-formatted solution document, while the debug property will contain the detailed debug output.

To optimize the skill's performance and reliability, the following adjustments can be made:

Use regex-based parsing to extract the file path or URL from the userRequest, instead of relying on AI-based parsing.
Implement caching mechanisms to store previously processed tasks and their corresponding solutions, reducing the need for redundant processing.
Use a combination of rule-based and AI-based approaches for generating the solution document, leveraging predefined templates and AI-generated explanations.
Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the skill.
Use markdown formatting consistently throughout the skill, both for internal processing and the final API response, to maintain simplicity and avoid potential parsing issues.
By addressing these questions and following the proposed solutions, the ARC Solver skill can be implemented as a robust and efficient DATA Skill within a single Next.js API route.

This skeleton provides the basic structure of the ARC Solver DATA Skill, including the necessary imports, main handler function, and the outline of each asynchronous constant function. The placeholder comments indicate where the actual implementation logic for each function should go.

The main execution flow is also included, demonstrating how the functions are called in sequence to load the task data, analyze train pairs, refine rules, apply rules to test pairs, format the solution document, send an SMS alert, and return the API response.

The try block contains the main execution flow, and the catch block handles any errors that may occur during execution, logging the error message and returning an appropriate error response.

The beautifulOrganizedMarkdownReply variable represents the formatted solution document, and the smsReply variable contains a brief message to be sent as an SMS alert.

Please note that the actual implementation logic for each function is not included in this skeleton and should be added based on the specific requirements and logic needed for the ARC Solver skill.

Functions
1. loadTaskFromFile: Loads the task JSON file from the provided file path or URL. Input: userRequest (string). Output: taskData (object).

```typescript
// loadTaskFromFile: Loads the task JSON file from the provided file path or URL const loadTaskFromFile = async (userRequest: string) => { try { let taskData = {};

// Check if userRequest is a valid URL
if (isValidUrl(userRequest)) {
  // Fetch the task JSON file from the URL
  const response = await fetch(userRequest);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to load task file from URL: ${userRequest}`);
  }
  taskData = await response.json();
} else {
  // Attempt to load the task JSON file from the local file system
  try {
    taskData = require(userRequest);
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Log the error and provide a fallback solution
    debug += `Error loading task file from local path: ${error.message}\n`;
    debug += `Attempting to load task file from GitHub...\n`;

    // Use runCommand to search for the task file on GitHub
    const githubSearchPrompt = `search the fchollet/ARC repository on GitHub for a task file matching the name: ${userRequest}`;
    const githubSearchResult = await runCommand('ultraBrowse', githubSearchPrompt, phoneNumber, email);

    // Extract the task file URL from the search result
    const taskFileUrlRegex = /https:\/\/raw\.githubusercontent\.com\/fchollet\/ARC\/master\/data\/\w+\/\w+\.json/;
    const taskFileUrlMatch = githubSearchResult.match(taskFileUrlRegex);

    if (taskFileUrlMatch) {
      const taskFileUrl = taskFileUrlMatch[0];
      debug += `Found task file on GitHub: ${taskFileUrl}\n`;

      // Fetch the task JSON file from the GitHub URL
      const response = await fetch(taskFileUrl);
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to load task file from GitHub URL: ${taskFileUrl}`);
      }
      taskData = await response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Could not find task file on GitHub: ${userRequest}`);
    }
  }
}

debug += `Loaded task data: ${JSON.stringify(taskData)}\n`;
return taskData;
} catch (error: any) { debug += Error in loadTaskFromFile: ${error.message}\n; // Return an empty object to allow the skill to continue executing return {}; } };
```
                      
2. parseTaskData: Parses the loaded task data to extract train and test pairs. Input: taskData (object). Output: { trainPairs: array, testPairs: array }.
Here's the implementation of the parseTaskData async constant function:
```typescript
// parseTaskData: Parses the loaded task data to extract train and test pairs
const parseTaskData = async (taskData: any) => {
  try {
    debug += `Parsing task data...\n`;
    console.log('Task data:', taskData);

    if (!taskData || typeof taskData !== 'object') {
      throw new Error('Invalid task data format. Expected an object.');
    }

    const trainPairs = taskData.train || [];
    const testPairs = taskData.test || [];

    if (!Array.isArray(trainPairs) || !Array.isArray(testPairs)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid train or test pairs format. Expected arrays.');
    }

    debug += `Extracted ${trainPairs.length} train pairs and ${testPairs.length} test pairs.\n`;
    console.log('Train pairs:', trainPairs);
    console.log('Test pairs:', testPairs);

    return { trainPairs, testPairs };
  } catch (error: any) {
    debug += `Error parsing task data: ${error.message}\n`;
    console.error('Error parsing task data:', error);
    return { trainPairs: [], testPairs: [] };
  }
};
```

This function takes the taskData object as input and extracts the train and test pairs from it. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

It starts by logging a debug message indicating that task data parsing has started and logs the taskData object to the console for debugging purposes.

It checks if taskData is a valid object. If not, it throws an error with an appropriate message.

It extracts the train and test pairs from the taskData object using the train and test properties, respectively. If these properties don't exist, it defaults to an empty array.

It checks if both trainPairs and testPairs are arrays. If not, it throws an error indicating an invalid format.

It logs debug messages indicating the number of train and test pairs extracted and also logs the actual pairs to the console for debugging.

Finally, it returns an object containing the trainPairs and testPairs arrays.

The function is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during parsing. If an error occurs, it logs the error message to the debug string and the console, and returns an object with empty trainPairs and testPairs arrays to ensure graceful failure.

Note that this function assumes that the taskData object has the expected structure with train and test properties containing arrays of pairs. It performs basic type checking and handles cases where these properties may be missing or have an incorrect format.

The function logs all relevant information to the debug string and the console for debugging and monitoring purposes.

3. analyzeTrainPairs: Uses AI to analyze the train pairs and identify transformation patterns. Input: trainPairs (array). Output: initialRules (array of strings).
Here's the implementation of the analyzeTrainPairs constant function:

```typescript
// analyzeTrainPairs: Uses AI to analyze the train pairs and identify transformation patterns.
const analyzeTrainPairs = async (trainPairs: any[]) => {
  try {
    const analyzeTrainPairsPrompt = {
      systemPrompt: `You are an AI assistant that analyzes train pairs to identify transformation patterns in the ARC Solver skill. Given a set of train pairs, your task is to analyze each pair and identify the transformation rules that convert the input grid to the output grid. Provide a clear, concise description of each transformation rule you identify.`,
      prompt: `Here are the train pairs to analyze:
<TrainPairs>
${JSON.stringify(trainPairs, null, 2)}
</TrainPairs>
Please analyze each train pair and identify the transformation rules that convert the input grid to the output grid. Provide a clear, concise description of each rule, one per line. If you are unsure or unable to identify a rule, simply write Unknown for that pair.
Reply with a markdown list of the rules, starting with the first rule now:`,
    };

    const initialRulesResponse = await gptRequest(
      model,
      0,
      analyzeTrainPairsPrompt.systemPrompt,
      analyzeTrainPairsPrompt.prompt,
      phoneNumber,
      email,
      1024
    );

    console.log('initialRulesResponse:', initialRulesResponse);
    debug += `Initial Rules Response:\n${initialRulesResponse}\n\n`;

    // Parse the initialRulesResponse into an array of strings
    const initialRules = initialRulesResponse
      .split('\n')
      .map((rule: string) => rule.trim())
      .filter((rule: string) => rule !== '');

    console.log('initialRules:', initialRules);
    debug += `Initial Rules:\n${JSON.stringify(initialRules, null, 2)}\n\n`;

    return initialRules;
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error in analyzeTrainPairs:', error.message);
    debug += `Error in analyzeTrainPairs: ${error.message}\n`;
    return []; // Return an empty array as a fallback
  }
};
```

This constant function does the following:

It defines a prompt object called analyzeTrainPairsPrompt that includes a system prompt and a prompt for the AI model. The system prompt describes the AI's role in analyzing train pairs to identify transformation patterns, while the prompt provides the specific train pairs to analyze and instructions on how to format the response.

It calls the gptRequest function with the necessary parameters, including the model, system prompt, prompt, phone number, email, and max tokens. This sends a request to the AI model to analyze the train pairs and identify transformation rules.

The response from the AI model is stored in the initialRulesResponse variable, and it is logged to the console and appended to the debug string for debugging purposes.

The initialRulesResponse is then parsed into an array of strings called initialRules. It splits the response by newline characters, trims each rule, and filters out any empty rules.

The initialRules array is logged to the console and appended to the debug string.

Finally, the function returns the initialRules array.

The function is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during execution. If an error is caught, it is logged to the console and appended to the debug string, and an empty array is returned as a fallback to allow the skill to continue executing.

4. refineRules: Iteratively refines the transformation rules based on the train pairs. Input: initialRules (array of strings), trainPairs (array). Output: refinedRules (array of strings).

```typescript
// refineRules: Iteratively refines the transformation rules based on the train pairs const refineRules = async (initialRules: string[], trainPairs: any[]) => { let refinedRules = [...initialRules];

const refineRulesPrompt = { systemPrompt: `You are an AI assistant that refines transformation rules for solving ARC tasks. You will be given an array of initial rules and an array of train pairs. Your task is to iteratively refine the rules based on the train pairs to better capture the underlying patterns.

Rules refinement process:
1. For each train pair, apply the current rules to the input grid and compare the result with the expected output grid.
2. If the result does not match the expected output, identify the discrepancies and update the relevant rules to address them.
3. Test the updated rules against all train pairs to ensure they produce the correct outputs.
4. If any discrepancies remain, repeat steps 2-3 until all train pairs are correctly solved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Remember to keep the rules as concise and generalizable as possible while still accurately capturing the transformation patterns. Avoid overfitting to specific train pairs.

Output format:
<RefinedRules>
1. Rule 1 description
2. Rule 2 description
...
</RefinedRules>`,
prompt: `Here are the initial rules:

<InitialRules>
${initialRules.join('\n')}
</InitialRules>

And here are the train pairs:

<TrainPairs>
${JSON.stringify(trainPairs, null, 2)}
</TrainPairs>

Please refine the rules based on the train pairs and return the updated rules in the specified format. Focus on capturing the general patterns rather than memorizing specific examples. Limit the refinement process to a maximum of 5 iterations.`
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { const refinementResult = await gptRequest(model, 0, refineRulesPrompt.systemPrompt, refineRulesPrompt.prompt, phoneNumber, email, 2000); debug += Refinement iteration ${i + 1}:\n${refinementResult}\n\n;

// Extract the refined rules from the GPT response
const refinedRulesMatch = refinementResult.match(/<RefinedRules>([\s\S]*?)<\/RefinedRules>/);
if (refinedRulesMatch) {
  refinedRules = refinedRulesMatch[1].trim().split('\n').map(rule => rule.trim());
  debug += `Extracted refined rules:\n${refinedRules.join('\n')}\n\n`;

  // Test the refined rules against all train pairs
  let allTrainPairsSolved = true;
  for (const pair of trainPairs) {
    const input = pair.input;
    const expectedOutput = pair.output;
    const actualOutput = applyRules(input, refinedRules);

    if (JSON.stringify(actualOutput) !== JSON.stringify(expectedOutput)) {
      allTrainPairsSolved = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (allTrainPairsSolved) {
    debug += 'All train pairs solved. Stopping refinement process.\n\n';
    break;
  }
} else {
  debug += 'Error: Could not extract refined rules from GPT response.\n\n';
  break;
}
}

debug += Final refined rules:\n${refinedRules.join('\n')}\n\n; return refinedRules; };

// Helper function to apply rules to an input grid (implementation not shown) const applyRules = (input: any[][], rules: string[]): any[][] => { // TODO: Implement logic to apply transformation rules to the input grid return []; };
```

5. applyRulesToTestPairs: Applies the refined rules to the test pairs to generate solutions. Input: refinedRules (array of strings), testPairs (array). Output: solutions (array of objects).

```typescript
// applyRulesToTestPairs: Applies the refined rules to the test pairs to generate solutions const applyRulesToTestPairs = async (refinedRules: string[], testPairs: any[]) => { try { debug += Applying refined rules to test pairs...\n; console.log(Refined Rules:\n${refinedRules.join('\n')}); console.log(Test Pairs:\n${JSON.stringify(testPairs, null, 2)});

const applyRulesPrompt = {
  systemPrompt: `You are an AI assistant that applies transformation rules to input grids to generate output grids. 
  The rules describe how to transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid. 
  Your task is to apply the given rules to each test pair and generate the solution output grid.`,

  prompt: `Here are the refined transformation rules:
  <Refined Rules>
  ${refinedRules.join('\n')}
  </Refined Rules>

  And here are the test pairs to apply the rules to:
  <Test Pairs>
  ${testPairs.map((pair, index) => `Test Pair ${index + 1}:\nInput:\n${JSON.stringify(pair.input)}`).join('\n\n')}
  </Test Pairs>

  For each test pair, apply the transformation rules to the input grid to generate the corresponding output grid. 
  Respond with a markdown list, where each list item represents a test pair solution in the following format:

  <Test Pair Solution>
  Test Pair [pair number]:
  Output:
  [JSON representation of the output grid]

  Step-by-Step Explanation:
  [Detailed step-by-step explanation of how the rules were applied to transform the input into the output]
  </Test Pair Solution>

  Pay close attention to edge cases and ensure the rules are applied consistently for each test pair.
  Reply with the markdown list of test pair solutions now.`
};

const solutionsResponse = await gptRequest(model, 0, applyRulesPrompt.systemPrompt, applyRulesPrompt.prompt, phoneNumber, email, 500);
console.log(`Generated Solutions:\n${solutionsResponse}`);

const solutionRegex = /<Test Pair Solution>[\s\S]*?<\/Test Pair Solution>/g;
const solutionMatches = solutionsResponse.match(solutionRegex);

const solutions = solutionMatches?.map((match) => {
  const pairNumber = match.match(/Test Pair (\d+):/)?.[1];
  const outputGrid = JSON.parse(match.match(/Output:\s*(\[[^\]]+\])/)?.[1] || '[]');
  const explanation = match.match(/Step-by-Step Explanation:\s*([\s\S]*)/)?.[1]?.trim();

  return {
    pairNumber: parseInt(pairNumber || '0'),
    outputGrid,
    explanation
  };
}) || [];

debug += `Generated ${solutions.length} solutions for the test pairs.\n`;

return solutions;
} catch (error: any) { debug += Error in applyRulesToTestPairs: ${error.message}\n; console.error('Error in applyRulesToTestPairs:', error); // Return an empty array as a fallback return []; } };
```

6. formatSolutionDocument: Formats the step-by-step solution and explanations in a markdown document. Input: solutions (array of objects), refinedRules (array of strings). Output: solutionDocument (string).
Here's the complete implementation of the formatSolutionDocument async constant function:
```typescript
// formatSolutionDocument: Formats the step-by-step solution and explanations in a markdown document
const formatSolutionDocument = async (solutions: any[], refinedRules: string[]) => {
  debug += `Formatting solution document with ${solutions.length} solutions and ${refinedRules.length} refined rules\n`;
  console.log(`Formatting solution document with ${solutions.length} solutions and ${refinedRules.length} refined rules`);

  const formatSolutionDocPrompt = {
    systemPrompt: `You are an AI assistant that specializes in formatting step-by-step solution documents for the ARC Solver skill.
Given an array of solution objects and an array of refined transformation rules, your task is to generate a well-structured markdown document that explains the solution process.
The document should include a step-by-step breakdown of how each test pair was solved using the refined rules, along with any necessary explanations or illustrations.`,

    prompt: `Here are the solution objects:
<Solutions>
${JSON.stringify(solutions, null, 2)}
</Solutions>

And here are the refined transformation rules:
<Refined Rules>
${refinedRules.join('\n')}
</Refined Rules>

Please format a detailed solution document in markdown format. The document should include:
1. An introduction explaining the task and the number of test pairs solved
2. A section for each test pair, including:
   - The test input grid (formatted as a markdown table)
   - The expected output grid (formatted as a markdown table) 
   - A step-by-step explanation of how the solution was derived using the refined rules
   - Any necessary illustrations or diagrams to clarify the transformation process
3. A conclusion summarizing the overall solution approach and any key insights

Feel free to use markdown formatting such as headings, bullet points, code blocks, and images to improve the clarity and readability of the document.
The document should be well-organized, easy to follow, and provide a comprehensive explanation of the solution process.

Please generate the complete solution document in markdown format now.`,
  };

  try {
    const solutionDocumentResponse = await gptRequest(
      model,
      0,
      formatSolutionDocPrompt.systemPrompt,
      formatSolutionDocPrompt.prompt,
      phoneNumber,
      email,
      2000
    );

    debug += `Generated solution document:\n${solutionDocumentResponse}\n`;
    console.log('Generated solution document:', solutionDocumentResponse);

    return solutionDocumentResponse;
  } catch (error: any) {
    debug += `Error generating solution document: ${error.message}\n`;
    console.error('Error generating solution document:', error);
    return 'An error occurred while generating the solution document. Please try again.';
  }
};
```
This formatSolutionDocument function takes in an array of solutions objects and an array of refinedRules strings as input. It then uses a gptRequest to generate a well-structured markdown document that explains the step-by-step solution process for each test pair.

The formatSolutionDocPrompt object contains the systemPrompt and prompt for the gptRequest. The systemPrompt sets the context for the AI assistant, specifying its role in formatting the solution document. The prompt provides the specific instructions and guidelines for generating the markdown document, including the desired structure and content.

The function first logs the number of solutions and refined rules to the debug output and console. It then makes the gptRequest with the formatted prompt, passing in the necessary parameters such as the model, phone number, email, and max tokens.

If the gptRequest is successful, the generated solution document is logged to the debug output and console, and then returned as a string.

If an error occurs during the gptRequest, it is caught and logged to the debug output and console. In case of an error, a generic error message string is returned instead.

This function ensures that the solution document is generated in a structured and readable markdown format, with step-by-step explanations, illustrations, and formatted input/output grids. The debug logging helps track the progress and identify any issues that may arise during the document generation process.

Note: The generateGridMarkdown function mentioned in the original prompt is not used in this implementation, assuming that the grid formatting is handled within the gptRequest itself.

7. generateGridMarkdown: Converts the input/output grids to markdown tables. Input: grid (array of arrays). Output: gridMarkdown (string).
```typescript
// generateGridMarkdown: Converts the input/output grids to markdown tables. Input: grid (array of arrays). Output: gridMarkdown (string). const generateGridMarkdown = async (grid: any[][]) => { if (!Array.isArray(grid) || grid.length === 0) { debug += 'Invalid grid input. Expected a non-empty array of arrays.\n'; return ''; }

const numRows = grid.length; const numCols = grid[0].length;

// Check if all rows have the same number of columns for (let i = 1; i < numRows; i++) { if (grid[i].length !== numCols) { debug += 'Inconsistent grid dimensions. All rows must have the same number of columns.\n'; return ''; } }

// Generate the markdown table header let gridMarkdown = '|'; for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) { gridMarkdown += ' |'; } gridMarkdown += '\n|'; for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) { gridMarkdown += '--|'; } gridMarkdown += '\n';

// Generate the markdown table rows for (let row = 0; row < numRows; row++) { gridMarkdown += '|'; for (let col = 0; col < numCols; col++) { const cellValue = grid[row][col]; gridMarkdown +=  ${cellValue} |; } gridMarkdown += '\n'; }

debug += Generated markdown table for grid with dimensions ${numRows}x${numCols}:\n${gridMarkdown}\n; return gridMarkdown; };
```
8. sendSmsAlert: Sends an SMS alert to notify the user that the solution is ready. Input: phoneNumber (string), solutionDocument (string). Output: None.
Here is the implementation of the sendSmsAlert async constant function:

```typescript
// sendSmsAlert: Sends an SMS alert to notify the user that the solution is ready
const sendSmsAlert = async (phoneNumber: string, solutionDocument: string) => {
  try {
    const smsSystemPrompt = `You are an SMS alert generator that notifies users when their ARC Solver solution is ready. Keep the message concise and under 160 characters.`;

    const smsPrompt = `
<SolutionDocument>
${solutionDocument}
</SolutionDocument>

Generate a brief SMS alert message notifying the user that their ARC Solver solution is ready and where they can find the full solution document. The message should be under 160 characters.

<OutputFormat>
[SMS alert message goes here, under 160 characters]
</OutputFormat>
    `;

    const smsReply = await gptRequest(model, 0, smsSystemPrompt, smsPrompt, phoneNumber, email, 200);

    debug += `SMS alert generated:\n${smsReply}\n`;
    console.log(`Sending SMS alert to ${phoneNumber}:`, smsReply);

    // TODO: Implement the actual SMS sending logic using an SMS API or service
    // For now, we'll just log the SMS alert to the console and debug info

  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error in sendSmsAlert:', error.message);
    debug += `Error in sendSmsAlert: ${error.message}\n`;
    // Handle the error gracefully without throwing
  }
};
```
This function does the following:

It defines the smsSystemPrompt and smsPrompt variables, which contain the system prompt and user prompt for generating the SMS alert message using the gptRequest function.

The smsPrompt includes the solutionDocument as context and specifies the desired output format for the SMS alert message.

It calls the gptRequest function with the provided model, phoneNumber, email, and other parameters to generate the SMS alert message.

The generated SMS alert message is captured in the smsReply variable.

The smsReply is logged to the debug information and console for visibility.

A placeholder comment is added to indicate where the actual SMS sending logic should be implemented using an SMS API or service. For now, the function just logs the SMS alert to the console and debug info.

The function is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during execution. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console and debug information, but the error is handled gracefully without throwing an exception.

Note: The actual implementation of sending the SMS using an SMS API or service is not included in this example and should be added based on the specific SMS provider or service being used.

This sendSmsAlert function can be called with the phoneNumber and solutionDocument arguments to generate and send an SMS alert to the user when their ARC Solver solution is ready.

9. returnSolutionResponse: Returns the formatted solution document and debug information as the API response. Input: solutionDocument (string), debug (string). Output: JSON object with message and debug.
Here is the implementation of the returnSolutionResponse constant function:
```typescript
// returnSolutionResponse: Returns the formatted solution document and debug information as the API response
const returnSolutionResponse = async (solutionDocument: string, debug: string) => {
  try {
    // Log the inputs
    console.log('Solution Document:', solutionDocument);
    console.log('Debug Information:', debug);

    // Prepare the API response object
    const response = {
      message: solutionDocument,
      debug: debug,
    };

    // Log the API response
    console.log('API Response:', response);

    // Return the API response
    return response;
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Log the error
    console.error('Error in returnSolutionResponse:', error.message);
    debug += `Error in returnSolutionResponse: ${error.message}\n`;

    // Prepare a fallback response in case of an error
    const fallbackResponse = {
      message: 'An error occurred while generating the solution response. Please try again.',
      debug: debug,
    };

    // Return the fallback response
    return fallbackResponse;
  }
};
```
This implementation follows the specified input and output types and includes error handling to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during execution.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

The function takes in two parameters: solutionDocument (string) and debug (string).

It starts by logging the input values to the console for debugging purposes.

It prepares the API response object with the message property set to the solutionDocument and the debug property set to the debug string.

The API response object is logged to the console.

The function returns the API response object.

If an error occurs during execution, it is caught in the catch block.

In case of an error, the error message is logged to the console and appended to the debug string.

A fallback response object is prepared with an error message and the updated debug string.

The fallback response is returned to ensure a graceful failure without crashing the execution.

By returning the API response as an object with the message and debug properties, the function provides a structured way to pass the solution document and debug information back to the API caller.

The error handling ensures that any errors during execution are properly logged and a fallback response is returned to prevent crashes.

Note: This implementation assumes that the solutionDocument and debug variables are properly formatted and contain the expected data. Additional validation or error handling can be added if needed.

# Context & Next Steps for arcSolver
Congrats on making a brand new DATA Skill called arcSolver! Please test this skill in the test replit DATA just wrote for you (Link expires at 2024-06-12T04:42:28.391Z) To run your skill & test it, just open that link and hit "run." If your Claim link has expired, you can always copy & paste the "Final API Route" code above into a fork of this Replit instead. Once you fork that replit, just search for the "newSkill.ts" file and paste you code there and it will function the same as a new claim would have to let you test & verify your new DATA Skill API route..

## Instructions for Using & Debugging arcSolver
Once you have your replit opened, scroll through your code found in ages/api/v1/skills and make sure to remove any accidental parts that are not code that got included (if any, usually none, but especially check the top & bottom of the file). From there, use Replit AI to fix any red underlined errors, (just highlight, hit the AI button, type "fix this" and voila most of the time that works). Once your code has no more red underlines, hit run, then open the webview tab. There you can run the skill with test inputs and adjust how it work to your liking, as well as review the Skill Definition to make sure it is accurate.

When it works how you like, you may email your source code to DATASkills@Lander.Media to have it added to DATA for everyone to use.

You can watch this short tutorial on trouble shooting & editing your skill here
