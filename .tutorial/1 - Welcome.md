# Welcome to building DATA Skills

## Overview: What is a DATA Skill?

DATA Skills are a special kind of Next.JS API Route that are designed _specifically_ for use as a voice or text-message based interface for HeyDATA.org. All DATA Skills can work with all language models, though some require smarter models to work well. 

Our goal with a DATA Skill is to give people an easy way to build and use software using natural language, basically to translate APIs into words.

### Input
Every DATA Skill only takes one kind of input: natural language, in any language.

### Output
Every DATA Skill outputs at least 3 objects: 
1. a markdown document
2. a short-form version of the final answer (like a text message or audio reply)
3. and a debug log that documents all the thinking that took place to produce the final output.

## Three Steps

Building a DATA Skill is easy! There are just three steps: review, test, and modify. Once you're happy with how your skill works, you can submit it and it will be live for everyone.

### First Step: Build, Check Skill Def
First, test your skill definition. That's step 1. If it shows up just like you're used to Skills displaying on the chat.heydata.org interface, that means your code compiles and runs, ready to continue testing functionality!

### Step 2: Run, Verify It Works

Step 2 is testing. You may notice that the code DATA wrote for you doesn't do *exactly* what you had in mind, depending on how detailed your original instructions were. So step 2 gives you a sense for how your skill will run when other people use it. We suggest trying a few different kinds of prompts, not just different inputs, but different levels of detail, testing "incorrect" or malformed inputs, etc.

### Step 3: Modify, Tune, Submit

Step 3 is your chance to customize your skill if it doens't work perfectly on the first try, or if you've had new ideas since first requesting your skill be made.

Every time you submit your skill, it will automatically create a new version, and the latest version will be the one people use by default unless they've chosen a favorite version to override the latest. Feel free to submit updates/changes to your skills as often as you like. You'll notice each time you submit your skill, DATA makes a new / updated version of your SkillDef that reflects any changes you make in the code, so your documentation & code comments always stay up to date!
